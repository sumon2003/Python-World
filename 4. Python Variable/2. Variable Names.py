Variable Names::>
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:
1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
2. A variable name cannot start with a number.
3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).
5. A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

#Example: Legal variable names =>
myvar = "Musafir" 
my_var = "Musafir"
_my_var = "Musafir" 
myVar = "Musafir" 
MYVAR = "Musafir"
myvar2 = "Musafir"
print(myvar)
print(my_var)
print(_my_var)
print(myVar)
print(MYVAR)
print(myvar2)

"""
Example: Illegal variable names=>

2myvar = "Musafir"
my-var = "Musafir"
my var = "Musafir"

#This example will produce an error in the result.

"""

# Remember that variable names are case-sensitive.

"""
Multi Words Variable Names
Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

Camel Case::>
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter.
Example: myVariableName = "Musafir"

Pascal Case::>
Each word starts with a capital letter.
Example: MyVariableName = "Musafir"

Snake Case::>
Each word is separated by an underscore character.
Example: my_variable_name = "Musafir"
