Multiline Comment::==->

1. Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
2. To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line.
   Example:   #This is a single line comment
              #This is a single line comment
              #This is a single line comment   
3. Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
   Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, 
   you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code,
   and place your comment inside it.
   Example: This whole script is also a multiline comment.
